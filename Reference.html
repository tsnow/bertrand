  <li>That you will not sell this software, modifications of this software, or any derived software for commercial gain.</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of this distribution is to encourage research into constraint languages. Please help this effort along by reporting (or preferably fixing) bugs as you find them.</p>
<p>I certainly do not view Bertrand as the &quot;ultimate&quot; constraint language &#8212; rather I hope it is a first step towards more generally useful constraint languages. I honestly enjoy using it, but much of my appreciation comes from prior spells of effort and frustration spent building constraint languages by hand. You, having had an easy life, might not instantly appreciate some of the finer points, and (not being constrained by those experiences) might even think of better ways to do some things. This is exactly why you have this software. Rewrite it. Change it. Make it useful.</p>
<p>To use Bertrand, you should have a copy of the book &quot;Constraint Programming Languages: Their Specification and Generation&quot; published by Addison-Wesley, 1988. This document explains some of the differences between the current software and that described in the book, and also discusses how to modify the interpreter for special purposes.</p>
<p>This software is a complete rewrite of the software described in the book, and contains some differences (mostly minor). Two of these differences affect mainly the speed of the interpreter:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This version of Bertrand does not use the fast pattern matching algorithm of Hoffmann and O'Donnell (described in Chapter 7). That algorithm made it difficult to modify the rule set dynamically. Also for typical uses it took longer to preprocess the rules than to run them. This change means that rules no longer have to obey &quot;strict left sequentiality&quot;. Unfortunately, it also means that it is much easier to write rules that get into infinite loops.</li>
  <li>This version of the interpreter actually implements the &quot;is&quot; operator, and the linear equation solver (written entirely in Bertrand) really does use it! Consequently, the equation solver runs more slowly, but it is much easier now to change the equation solver to try out more ambitious equation solving rules (since they are not implemented in C). If you want to implement part of the equation solver in C, there are some routines in mole.c that you might find useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>One point in the book bears repeating. Do not think of Bertrand as a general-purpose problem-solving system. It is very easy to throw problems at Bertrand that it cannot possibly solve. A common mistake is to try to use Bertrand like a logic programming language such as Prolog (I view this as a deficiency, and would love to see someone combine Bertrand with a logic programming language). To use Bertrand effectively you <em>really must understand how Augmented Term Rewriting works</em>.</p>
<p>A final warning. Like most software, the ultimate guide to Bertrand is the source, and the best way to learn how to use it is to start with the examples and build on them. Good luck!</p>
<h2>Using Bertrand</h2>
<p>Bertrand is typically used in conjunction with one or more libraries:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>bops</strong>, the standard Bertrand operator definitions, which defines most of the operators that typical Bertrand programs will use.</li>
  <li><strong>beep</strong>, the Bertrand elementary equation processing library, which defines operators and rules for solving equations.</li>
  <li><strong>bag</strong>, the Bertrand graphics library.</li>
</ul>
<p>These libraries are included explicitly in Bertrand programs, as desired, using the #include directive (see discussion on the preprocessor, below).</p>
<p>To invoke Bertrand, type:</p>
<p> bert <em>filename</em></p>
<p>Where <em>filename</em> is a file containing your rules. One of these rules should be the <em>main</em> rule - its head should consist of the single operator &quot;main&quot;. Alternatively, Bertrand can be run in a pipeline, by feeding the rules into standard input. Bertrand will run until there are no mor rewrites to be done, and then print out the final subject expression.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>Since the primary purpose of Bertrand is to define other languages, it is important for it to have as little syntax as possible. Bertrand understands the following input:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alphanumeric names, including upper and lower case letters, numeric digits, and underscore (_). Names must begin with an alphabetic character.</li>
  <li>Numbers, containing only numeric digits and possibly a single decimal point. Note that negative numbers and scien tific notation must be defined using rules (which they are, in beep). See the discussion on matching numbers, below.</li>
  <li>Whitespace, which is used to delimit alphanumeric names. Includes space, tab, newline, and the formfeed character. Formfeeds can be freely inserted to force page breaks in Bertrand programs.</li>
  <li> Other characters, which are anything else except reserved characters. These characters are used to make one or two character operator names, for example: <code>+ &gt;= &amp; -&gt;</code> .</li>
  <li>The only reserved characters are the period, left and right curly braces, the hash sign, and all three quote marks. The multitalented period is used as a decimal point (for example, the number 3.14), to delimit compound names (for example, the name rectangle.width), and for comments, which begin with two or more adjacent periods, and run to the end of the line. As a matter of style, an ellipsis (three periods) is often used to begin comments to set them off better. Curly braces ({}) are used to enclose the bodies of rules. The hash sign (#) is used to begin preprocessor statements. Single quotes (') are used to begin type names. Double quotes (&quot;) are used to delimit strings. Within strings, back quotes (`) are used for special characters, as follows:<br />
    <br />
    
    <table width="341" border="0">
      <tr>
        <td width="27"><code>`b</code></td>
        <td width="304">backspace</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>`f</code></td>
        <td>formfeed</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>`n</code></td>
        <td>newline</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>`r</code></td>
        <td>carriage return</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>`t</code></td>
        <td>tab</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>`&quot;</code></td>
        <td>double quote (that doesn't end the string)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>``</code></td>
        <td>back quote</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>To change any of the above, see the file scanner.c.<br />
</p>
<h2>The Preprocessor</h2>
<p>All preprocessor statements begin with a hash sign (#) in the first column and run to the end of the line. A preprocessor statement may contain a comment (which necessarily terminates the preprocessor statement). The following preprocessor statements are recognized:</p>
<p>#operator <em>definition</em><br />
  #op <em>definition</em><br />
  Used to define an operator. All operators must be defined to the system, otherwise they are assumed to be variables. Within operator definitions the following keywords are recognized:</p>
<table width="385" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="92">nullary</td>
    <td width="283">nullary</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>unary</td>
    <td>unary</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>prefix</td>
    <td>unary prefix</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>postfix</td>
    <td>unary postfix</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>outfix</td>
    <td>unary outfix</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>matchfix</td>
    <td>unary outfix</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>binary</td>
    <td>binary infix</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>infix</td>
    <td>binary infix</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>left</td>
    <td>binary infix left associative</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>right</td>
    <td>binary infix right associative</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>non</td>
    <td>binary infix nonassociative</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>nonassociative</td>
    <td>binary infix nonassociative</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>associative</td>
    <td>(usually preceded by the keyword &quot;non&quot;)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>precedence</td>
    <td>(usually followed by a number)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>supertype</td>
    <td>(usually followed by a typename)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Most of these keywords are optional. The default arity is nullary. Unary operators default to prefix. Infix operators default to nonassociative. Outfix operators must have two operator names, and do not need to be given a precedence. Precedence values are completely arbitrary &#8212; see bops for some ideas. Special functions (see below) are indicated by a hash sign (#) followed by a number. For examples of operator definitions, see the libraries, especially bops.</p>
<p>#primitive <em>definition</em><br />
  Used to give a supertype to an operator or type that is already known to the system. For example:</p>
<p> #primitive true supertype 'boolean<br />
defines the operator &quot;true&quot; to be a subtype of 'boolean. The keyword &quot;supertype&quot; is optional. Note that the operator or type need not be truly primitive. For example, beep uses this directive to give supertypes to some of the types defined in bops.</p>
<p>#type <em>definition</em><br />
Used to define a type, which must begin with a single quote. A type may optionally have a single supertype. The keyword &quot;supertype&quot; is optional.</p>
<p>#include <em>filename</em><br />
  Reads input from <em>filename</em>, and when done resumes reading the current file. These may be nested to a depth of 16 files. The filename may be enclosed in double quotes if it contains any spaces, in which case it may not contain any double quotes.</p>
<p>#trace <em>number</em><br />
  #quiet<br />
  Turn tracing on and off. The argument to trace is the level of tracing, where #trace 0 is the same as #quiet. If the argument is omitted, it defaults to 1. See the discussion of tracing, below.</p>
<p>#line <em>number</em><br />
  Used to change the line number that Bertrand thinks it is reading. Only affects error messages. Typically used only by programs that generate Bertrand code.</p>
<p>Look in bops, beep and bag for examples of preprocessor statements. The file prep.c contains the code that interprets these statements.</p>
<h2>Special Functions</h2>
<p>Some operators can be defined to be special &#8212; they invoke special functions in the Bertrand interpreter. There are two types of special functions, those performed by the parser (at the time the input file is read in), and those performed at run time. All of the parse-time functions, and one run-time function, are fundamental to the operation of the Bertrand interpreter. These functions are as follows:<br />
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Parser reduce function to throw an operator away.
    Defined in bops to be parentheses. This allows
    parentheses to be used for grouping, without actually
    appearing in the parsed expression. Can be used to
    make any operator be a no-op.</li>
  <li>Parser reduce function for labels. Defined in bops to be a colon (:). A label is used to give a name to an object, or to provide access to the local variables of a rule.</li>
  <li>Parser reduce function to negate a constant number. This function is only required because of an obscure problem with numbers that might get cured in a future release. See the discussion on matching numbers, below.</li>
    <li>Run-time function to prevent evaluation of a subexpression. Defined in bops to be square brackets ([]). Prevents the pattern matcher from searching its argu ment for redexes. Normal Bertrand rules can be used to remove the brackets (which can themselves be pattern<br />
  matched), as in the following rules:<br />
  <code>eval [ expr ] { expr }<br />
  if true then [ truepart ] else [ falsepart ] { truepart }<br />
  if false then [ truepart ] else [ falsepart ] { falsepart }</code><br />
  Warning: this is a procedural hack to Bertrand that should only be used to gain execution speed. In particular, none of the examples or libraries use this.</li>
</ol>
<p>These special functions can be assigned to specific operators in operator definitions with a hash sign followed by the special operator number. Here is the line from bops that defines parentheses to be thrown away.</p>
<p><code>#op ( ) #1 outfix</code></p>
<p>See bops for other examples.</p>
<p>It is also possible to write a C function and assign it to a specific operator. This has already been done in the interpreter for such things as the addition primitive for adding two numbers together, and the graphics primitives. It is relatively straightforward to add your own primitives. Look in the file primitive.c to see how this is done.</p>
<p>The graphics primitives call routines in graphics.c, written for Sun's NeWS window system. These routines, however, would be very easy to port over to some other window system, if desired.</p>
<h2>Matching Numbers</h2>
<p>In the attempt to keep Bertrand as simple as possible, a strange problem with numbers was created. The Bertrand scanner only recognizes positive numbers, possibly containing a single decimal point. For example, what might appear to be the negative constant -3, is actually a unary minus sign (an operator) followed by the positive constant 3. The effect of this is that negative numbers cannot be used in the head of a rule. In the body of a rule, of course, the above will be immediately rewritten into a negative number. Used in the head of a rule, however, it causes Bertrand to search (literally) for the pattern of a minus sign followed by a positive number, which it will never find.</p>
<p>The same problem applies to numbers in Bertrand's (somewhat different) scientific notation. In beep, the double caret (^^) operator is defined using the rule</p>
<p> <code>a ^^ b { a * 10^b }</code></p>
<p>Consequently, the number <code>-25^^-3</code> is really an expression containing two numbers and three operators, which will be rewritten (by beep) into the number -0.025. (Note that we could define an operator &quot;e&quot; to allow the above number to be written as <code>-25e-3</code>).</p>
<p>A temporary solution was implemented as a special parser reduce function that negates its argument at parse time. This function is usually assigned to the name &quot;neg&quot; in bops. Thus the expression &quot;neg 3&quot; is changed (by the parser) into the constant -3. No corresponding fix was deemed necessary for numbers in scientific notation, since it is usually a very bad idea to try to do a pattern match against anything other than an integer.</p>
<p>The real solution is to change the scanner to treat the minus sign as a (possibly) reserved character to be used for negative numbers. This would mean, however, that <code>- 3</code> (with a space) and <code>-3</code> (no space) would parse differently. We could also use the standard convention for scientific notation and treat the characters &quot;e&quot; and &quot;E&quot; specially. Note that since we use the C library functions for printing, numbers already print out in this form.</p>
<p>The code for all this nonsense is in scanner.c.</p>
<h2>Tracing</h2>
<p>When tracing is off, Bertrand only prints out the fully transformed subject expression when it is done running. The preprocessor statements #trace and #quiet can be used to print out diagnostic information about a sequence of rewritings.</p>
<p>Tracing is an attribute of specific rules &#8212; the tracing value of a rule is the value in effect when it was parsed. At parse time, traced rules are printed out, along with their local name spaces. At run time, traced rules are printed out when they are matched, along with the complete subject expression both before and after the rewrite.</p>
<p>The state of tracing is actually a numeric value, and whether a rule is traced is actually a function of both the state of tracing when the rule was parsed, and when the match is made. At run time, the tracing value of the rule and the current tracing value are added together. If this number is greater than two, then the rule is traced. For example, consider the following set of rules:</p>
<p> <code>#trace 0<br />
  ruleA { body }<br />
  #trace 1<br />
  ruleB { body }<br />
  #trace 2<br />
  ruleC { body }<br />
  #trace</code><br />
</p>
<p>At run time, tracing is (initially) as the parser left it, in this case 1, so rules B and C will be traced. If instead, tracing is set to 0 (perhaps using #quiet), then rule C will still be traced. But if tracing is set to 2, then all rules will be traced. At run time, tracing can be changed dynamically using the &quot;trace&quot; operator, which takes a single numeric argument. Finally, if a file has tracing on, then any file it #includes will (initially) have the same tracing value, but changes made to the tracing in the #included file will not affect tracing in the original file.</p>
<h2>Types</h2>
<p>When expressions are printed out by Bertrand, the type of each variable will be printed. Initially, all variables are undeclared, which prints out as the type <code>'?</code>. In Bertrand, variables are declared using object-constructing rules. If a variable is never declared by the programmer, it will remain of type '?, which should be considered an error by the programmer. If a variable is declared using a rule that has no type, then it will become untyped, which prints out as no type at all.<br />
