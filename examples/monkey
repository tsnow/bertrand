.. Brainteaser from "Games for the Super-Intelligent" by Jim Fixx
..
.. A rope lying over the top of a fence is the same length on each side.
.. It weighs one third of a pound per foot. On one side hangs a monkey
.. holding a banana, and on the other end a weight equal to the weight
.. of the monkey. The banana weighs two ounces per inch. The rope is as
.. long (in feet) as the age of the monkey (in years), and the weight
.. of the monkey (in ounces) is the same as the age of the monkey's
.. mother. The combined age of the monkey and its mother is thirty years.
.. One half of the weight of the monkey, plus the weight of the banana,
.. is one fourth as much as the weight of the weight and the weight of
.. the rope. The monkey's mother is half as old as the monkey will be
.. when it is three times as old as its mother was when she was half as
.. old as the monkey will be when it is as old as its mother will be when
.. she is four times as old as the monkey was when it was twice as old as
.. its mother was when she was one third as old as the monkey was when it
.. was as old as its mother was when she was three times as old as the
.. monkey was when it was one fourth as old as it is now.
.. How long is the banana?
